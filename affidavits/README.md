The [ECI Affidavit Archive](http://affidavitarchive.nic.in/) has archives of candidate affidavits (i.e. declarations) as PDF files of images.

This script crawls and downloads these for Parliamentary elections, and also creates a CSV file that has the mapping of file name to constituency details.

The CSV file is at
<https://github.com/datameet/india-election-data/blob/master/affidavits/affidavits.csv>.

The source is at
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/datameet/india-election-data/master/affidavits/affidavits.ipynb>.

To get the actual PDF files, you'll have to run the scraper yourself. The data is too large to be conveniently stored in a git repository.
